# JARVIS-Voice-ASSISTANT
A simple voice assistant that can interact with your pc and open stuff.

# Its still in beta even with the 2 versions. I'm still workiong on it, so maybe expect updates, I don't know.

**What do to**
Go into Voice Assistant File, there will be folders labeled "V1", "V2" and so on (depending on how many versions I make)
The higher the version number, usually the more complex. 

in V2, you have to go and edit all the directories and stuff. They are labbel with # --------------------------------------------------- LABEL ------------------------------------- so you can see them easier.

Once you have done that (and made sure to download every lib needed), you can use it.

### Also you cant delete the mp3 file without make the program make another so fix that if you want.
